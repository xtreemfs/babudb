2009-12-08: release 0.3.0
  * first stable release with snapshot support
	
2010-01-13: release 0.3.1
  * added support for automatic recovery from incomplete log files on startup
	
2010-02-05: release 0.3.2
  * fixed a bug that prevented future checkpoints from being created if a
    crash occurred during a checkpoint
  * further improved robustness when recovering from a broken log file
  
2010-03-02: release 0.3.3
  * enabled support for huge databases on 32-bit systems
  * improved robustness when errors occur while a checkpoint is created

2010-05-11: release 0.4.0
  * added backup functionality for databases
  * fixed checkpointing issues on Windows machines
  * changed modularization: Foundation.jar, Flease.jar and yidl.jar now need to be added to the classpath in order to run BabuDB
  
2010-06-08: release 0.4.1
  * improved crash resilience if the database system is forcefully shut down during a checkpoint
  * fixed a bug that could cause memory shortage on 32bit machines if the system is restarted with a large database
  
2010-08-31: release 0.4.2
  * added configuration builder to simplify the configuration of BabuDB
  * fixed issues #6, #7, #10
  
2010-09-20: release 0.4.3
  * substantially reduced the memory footprint of checkpoint operations
  * added configuration options to disable and control memory-mapping of database files
  * improved robustness when shutting down databases while checkpoints are being created
  
2010-09-27: release 0.4.4
  * fixed a bug that could cause data loss during checkpoints if memory mapping was disabled
  * added support for range queries
  * fixed synchronization issues at index level
  * added tool that creates an XML dump of all databases
  
2010-10-21: release 0.4.5
  * fixed issue #12, which caused a failure when trying to initialize a database with an LSN > 2^31
  
2011-04-21: release 0.5.0
  * moved all interfaces that may be accessed by user applications into the separate package org.xtreemfs.babudb.api
  * added plugin mechanism that separates BabuDB core functionality from additional features such as replication
  * moved all replication-specific code into a separate plugin, which can be found in the replication subdirectory
  * iterators formerly returned upon prefix and range lookups have been replaced with result sets, which should be explicitly freed to minimize memory footprint

2011-05-19: release 0.5.1
  * fixed bug that caused problems with the log replay in the event of asynchronous log appends
  * BabuDB shutdowns are now performed gracefully by default, which means that pending log appends will be written to disk before terminating the database
  * Added support for light-weight transactions. A light-weight transaction atomically executes a list of arbitrary modifications, including database creations and deletions, insertions and deletions of records, as well as snapshots.
